           <h1>About King Ashoka</h1> 
           <p>Ashoka's fame is largely due to his pillar and rock edicts, which allowed him to reach a wide audience and left a lasting historical record. He is remembered as a model ruler, controlling a vast and diverse Mauryan empire through peace and respect, with dharma at the centre of his ideology. </p>
