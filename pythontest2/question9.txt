# What are all the ways we have to develop an API with django restframework. Talk about different classes we can use to develop an  API

the different types of ways :

1. APIView 
2. viewset
3. Modelviewset
4. generics

1. in APIView this is one way to develop api in this we need to write functions 
   for all methods get,post,put,patch,delete 
2  If we use modelviewset,viewset internally it call all http methods like create,retrive,update,delete 
   we no need to define methods again
