What is the best way handle the errors in djangorestapi. Marks will be considered based on the scenarios covered.  


Answer :  there many types of errors 
401 error unauthenticated error 
502 error bad gateway 


If we get get any errors 401,403,404,402 we need the errors in business logic views
we import status from django and while sending rensponse to the clents we send status code in rensponse.

if we get any errors like 500,502 errors example if we get 502 error it is a bad gateway request that means 
we need to configure gateway properly .
