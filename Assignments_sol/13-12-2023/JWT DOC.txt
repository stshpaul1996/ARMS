The flow of JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication typically involves several steps to authenticate and authorize a user.
 Below is a simplified explanation of the JWT authentication flow:

User Authentication Request:

The user provides credentials (such as username and password) to the server to log in.
Server Authentication and Token Generation:

The server verifies the user's credentials.
If the credentials are valid, the server creates a JWT containing the user's information (such as user ID, role, etc.).
This JWT is signed with a secret key known only to the server.
Token Issuance:

The server sends the JWT back to the client (typically in the response body or headers) after successful authentication.
Token Storage on Client Side:

The client (usually a web or mobile application) receives the JWT and stores it securely. Common storage locations include browser local storage or device memory.
Subsequent Requests with JWT:

For subsequent requests to protected resources or APIs, the client includes the JWT in the request headers (commonly in the Authorization header with the Bearer prefix).
Token Verification by Server:

When the client sends a request to access protected resources, it includes the JWT.
The server intercepts the request and verifies the JWT's signature using the secret key.
If the signature is valid, the server parses the JWT and checks its validity, expiration, and other claims.
Access or Denial of Resources:

If the JWT is valid, not expired, and passes all verification checks, the server grants access to the requested resource or API endpoint.
If the JWT is invalid (e.g., expired, tampered, or unauthorized), the server denies access and returns an appropriate error response (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).
Token Refresh (Optional):

If the JWT has an expiration time and the token is expired, the client can request a new token using a refresh token (if provided by the server).
The refresh token allows the client to request a new JWT without re-authenticating with the username and password.
Logging Out (Optional):

To log out, the client can simply discard the JWT or take additional steps, such as sending a request to invalidate the token on the server-side (optional).
JWT authentication provides a stateless way to authenticate users by securely transmitting claims between parties (client and server) as a JSON object.
 The token's self-contained nature simplifies scalability and facilitates secure communication between client and server without the need for session storage on the server side.
