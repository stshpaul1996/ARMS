    <p>Optimus Prime (formerly known as Orion Pax) is constantly, if not always, depicted as having strong moral character, 
      excellent leadership, and sound decision-making skills, and possesses brilliant military tactics, 
      powerful martial arts, and advanced extraterrestrial weaponry. Optimus Prime has a strong sense of honor and justice, 
      being dedicated to building peaceful and mutually beneficial co-existence with humans, the protection of life and liberty of all sentient species. 
      As the current Matrix of Leadership bearer, Optimus Prime is the de facto leader of the Autobots, 
      a faction of a transforming species of synthetic intelligence from the planet Cybertron. 
      The Autobots are constantly waging civil war against a rival faction of transforming robots called Decepticons.</p> -->
