    "Optimus Prime (formerly known as Orion Pax) is constantly, if not always, depicted as having "

    "Optimus Prime has a strong sense of honor and justice, being dedicated to building peaceful "
    "and mutually beneficial co-existence with humans, the protection of life and liberty of all "
    "sentient species. As the current Matrix of Leadership bearer, Optimus Prime is the de facto "

    "Bumblebee (known as Abejorro in Mexico, Bumble in Japan, Moscardo in Portugal, Űrdongó in Hungary, "
    "Maggiolino in Italy) is the 'little brother' of the heroic Autobots and a mascot, constantly striving "
    "to prove himself in the eyes of the other robots—especially his leader, Optimus Prime. This often causes "
    "him to take risks and put himself in danger. He is portrayed as a smart aleck, a capable, reliable messenger "
    "and spy, and his small size allows him to go places that his larger commanders cannot. He is highly fuel-efficient, "
    "has great visual acuity, is particularly adaptable to undersea environments, and transforms into a Saturn yellow Volkswagen Beetle."
